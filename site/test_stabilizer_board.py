"""The general stabilizer leaderboard (issue #2131).

Stabilizer entries render on docs/stabilizer.html and never on the CSS board;
their code page shows one Pauli-weight distance, the witness as a Pauli
string, and the generators as Pauli strings. Fixtures: the [[5,1,3]] code the
verifier ships and the CSS [[72,6,6]] fixture, so nothing here depends on a
board file a refutation could later remove.
