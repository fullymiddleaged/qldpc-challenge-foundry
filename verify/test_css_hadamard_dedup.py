"""A CSS entry is deduped up to local Hadamards, as a stabilizer entry already was.

Before this, the relation a submission was deduped under depended on the
`code_type` the submitter wrote: a Hadamard relabelling of a board entry was
caught when typed `stabilizer`, because the verifier filed it under its CSS
image, and missed when typed `CSS`, because the fingerprint keys on the RREF
and the relabelling changes it. These tests pin the symmetry.
