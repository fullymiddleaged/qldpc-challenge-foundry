"""Board-wide audit: the three frontier implementations must agree.

A code is a record of its track cell when no other code in that cell beats it
on all of (n, k, d, w). That one relation is implemented three times:

* ``site/build.py:compute_records`` -- the star rendered on the board;
* ``validate_candidate`` gates.novelty -- what a contributor is told
  ("advances the board cell") and what ``build_receipt`` records;
* ``gate_changed.board_record_slugs`` -- which claims get the deep refutation
  battery instead of the fast pass.

If they disagree, the gate, the receipt, the rendered star, and the refutation
budget name different record-holders. On the 2026-09-29 board the budget's
hand-rolled locality mirror (``gate_changed._locality_rank``) had drifted from
the verifier and flipped the record status of 17 entries -- caught only by
comparing the implementations across all of codes/.

That comparison needs a full structural pass over the board plus one gate
verdict per entry (~5 minutes), so it is not in the PR gate: this file is not
named test_*.py, pytest never auto-collects it, and the weekly refute job
(refute-weekly.yml) runs it as its own step. The per-rule pinning of the
mirror stays in verify/test_frontier_consistency.py (seconds, PR gate).

Run standalone:  uv run --frozen python verify/board_frontier_audit.py
Exit 0 iff all three checks agree.
