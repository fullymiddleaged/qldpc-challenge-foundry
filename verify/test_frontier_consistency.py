"""The budget gate's locality mirror must agree with the verifier (fast tests).

``gate_changed._locality_rank`` re-derives the locality class to pick the
refutation budget, while ``site/build.py`` and ``validate_candidate`` read the
verifier's ``computed.locality_class``. The mirror historically omitted the
verifier's 1e-9 float tolerances and its planar-only rule; on the 2026-09-29
board that demoted 27 honest local-2d-bilayer entries to unrestricted and
flipped the record status of 17 of them -- 14 starred entries were refuted
with the fast pass instead of the deep battery.

Each fast test pins one of the verifier's classification rules, one per
historical divergence, by comparing the mirror against ``verify()`` itself on
a crafted fixture. The board-wide audit (all three frontier implementations,
every entry) lives in verify/board_frontier_audit.py and runs in the weekly
refute job, not here: a full structural pass over codes/ is minutes, and this
file stays in the PR gate at seconds.
