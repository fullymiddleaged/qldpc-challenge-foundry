r"""promote -- assemble the submission bundle for a candidate the gate has passed.

The gate is fast and the search is the interesting part, but the stretch between
``validate_candidate.py`` returning ``passed: true`` and an open PR is neither:
it is a fixed list of mechanical steps (copy the validated document into
``codes/``, retype the ladder into ``notes/<slug>.md``, fill the PR body's
checklist and frontier section, run the prose check) that has been rewritten as
throwaway shell once per campaign. Issue #2328 measures what that costs and
where it fails: glue that scrapes the CLI's human-oriented output, fails to
parse it, and fails silently.

This module is the same tail with a machine-readable contract. It takes a
validated candidate plus an *evidence record* holding the ladder, the sweep
counts, and the dead ends the campaign already produced, and returns one JSON
report:

    {"schema": "qldpc-promote/1", "ok": true, "slug": "...", "title": "...",
     "branch": "...", "files": {...}, "body_file": "...", "gates": {...},
     "blocked_by": [...], "needs_human": [...], "commands": [...]}

``ok`` is the verdict. Nothing has to be read out of printed prose, so a
batch driver is a loop over ``promote_all`` and a check of one boolean.

What it does NOT do, on purpose:

* **It never weakens a gate.** ``verify/`` is read, never written. Every bundle
  runs the trusted gate (``validate_candidate``, full refutation on a fresh
  seed) on the FINAL document, and then ``verify/check_prose.py`` on the body
  and the files, in that order. A failure is a blocker, and the checker's own
  output is carried into the report verbatim.
* **It never re-searches for a witness.** The candidate arrives validated and
  its witnesses are already checked by the verifier; searching again is the
  45 minutes issue #2328 measures. Because skipping that search also removes
  the deep pass ``qldpc submit`` would have run, the bundle is refused unless
  the evidence record shows the ladder already spent at least
  ``DEFAULT_MIN_DEEP_TRIALS`` trials per side on a fresh seed and settled
  there: the depth is required, not the repetition. A ladder rung reading
  BELOW the claimed distance is a blocker, not a rounding difference.
* **It never runs git or gh.** Publication authorization is a human's, per
  ``AGENTS.md``; the report carries the exact command sequence and
  ``--script`` writes it out, so no campaign has to invent one again.
* **It does not generate the circuit tier.** ``./qldpc submit`` does that, and
  a candidate that should carry circuits is reported as needing one rather
  than quietly shipped without.

Usage::

    uv run --frozen python research/kit/promote.py plan.json [plan2.json ...] \
        --authors @handle --json bundles.json --script open-prs.sh

A *plan* is ``{"candidate": "<path to the validated JSON>", "evidence": {...}}``
or a list of those. ``EVIDENCE_REQUIRED`` names the fields the note cannot be
written without; they are the research judgment the tool has no way to derive.
