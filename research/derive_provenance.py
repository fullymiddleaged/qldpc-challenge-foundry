"""Derive each board entry's provenance from the isomorphism check, not from its label.

The board cannot currently answer "did this come from the literature or from a
search run here", which is what a literature-versus-discovered comparison needs
(issue #1279). The declared fields do not support it: of 1,560 entries, 1,280
say ``provenance.origin: submission`` and 1,074 carry no ``novelty`` at all,
while 556 of them cite a paper in their own construction text. ``submission``
records the path an entry arrived by, not where the code came from, and
relabelling by hand would reproduce the same problem the first time someone
forgets a field.

So the tag is computed instead. ``research/provenance/iso_check.py`` decides
permutation
equivalence of the given generating sets with nauty's canonical form of the
typed Tanner graph and re-verifies every hit by mapping row spaces with the
recovered qubit permutation. This module turns that output into one bucket per
slug:

``literature``
    isomorphic to a published code, with the source and its reference.
``parameters_only``
    a published code shares its (n, k, d) but no matrices are indexed for it,
    so equivalence cannot be decided either way. The non-abelian 2BGA rows are
    here until a GAP run, and codetables.de bounds are here permanently.
``no_match``
    nothing in the index matches. **Not a proof of independence**: two sparse
    generating sets of the same stabilizer group can have non-isomorphic Tanner
    graphs, so this bucket means "not found", not "not published".
``not_derived``
    the index has not been run against this entry at all. Distinct from
    ``no_match``, which means it was run and found nothing, and the distinction
    is the whole point: an entry nobody has checked must not be counted as one
    checked and cleared.

Coverage is therefore a state the table can represent rather than an error.
That matters because regenerating needs the literature index, which is not
shipped, so a board that grows cannot be reconciled by whoever merged the code.
``--top-up`` adds ``not_derived`` rows for new entries and drops rows for
entries that left, needs neither the index nor pynauty, and a later
``--from-matches`` promotes those rows. ``--check`` hard-fails only on things
that are wrong (an unknown bucket, ``literature`` with no evidence, counts that
disagree with the entries) and reports mere staleness loudly without failing,
which is what this module docstring promised before it could deliver it.

Two things this deliberately does not do. It does not write to ``codes/``,
because a derived field that lives in the submission document would drift from
the derivation the moment the index grows; the table is the artifact and the
entry is joined to it by slug. And it does not touch ``verify/``: nothing here
gates a submission, it only reports.
